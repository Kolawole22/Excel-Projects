# Excel project

This is a demonstration of some of my Microsoft excel skills.
There are two projects here; 

data cleaning using sort and filter, find and replace, transpose, text to column and pivot table

I created an excel dashboard where I used my knowledge of pivot tables, pivot charts, maps
slicers and timeline to create an interactive dashboard.
